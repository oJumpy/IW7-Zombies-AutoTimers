# Recommendations for AutoSplitter:
- I recommend downloading this [Useful](https://github.com/oJumpy/IW7-Zombies-AutoTimers/releases/download/v1/Useful.zip) stuff
- [My Layout](https://github.com/oJumpy/IW7-Zombies-AutoTimers/releases/download/v1/recommended_layout.lsl) For best results
- Make sure your LiveSplit is comparing against Game Time and for SubSplits, Splits, Timer, Detailed Timer, Etc... in "Timing Method" I recommend using "Current Timing Method"

If you are going to make your own layout:
- Make sure it's comparing to **Game Time**
- Use SubSplits
- Use Detailed Timer

 **Auto-Splitting** – Triggers on every round change  
 **Reset Tracker** – Tracks time and value until engine overflow
